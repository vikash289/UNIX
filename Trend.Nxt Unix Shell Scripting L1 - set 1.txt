"Script should execute a command which creates an
 error. The error statement should be redirected the console"
Solution.
 dir file.xxx 1> output.msg 2>&1
 
"Script to execute a system command and the output
 to be directed to a new file and execute another
 system command and update the same file (append)"
Solution.
 dir file.xxx > output.msg 2> output.err
